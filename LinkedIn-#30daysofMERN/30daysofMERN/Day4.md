### Day 4: State Management with useState Hook

Welcome to Day 4 of our #30daysofMERNstack series! Today, we're going to dive into state management in React, focusing on the `useState` hook. By the end of this article, you'll understand what component state is and how to use the `useState` hook to manage state in functional components.

#### Understanding Component State

State is a built-in React object used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time, and whenever it changes, the component re-renders to reflect the new state. This allows for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

Unlike props, which are read-only and passed down from parent to child components, state is local to the component and can be modified within the component.

#### The useState Hook

The `useState` hook is a function that lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array containing the current state and a function to update that state.

Hereâ€™s the basic syntax of the `useState` hook:

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

- `state`: The current state value.
- `setState`: A function that lets you update the state.
- `initialState`: The initial value of the state.

#### Using the useState Hook

Let's create a simple counter example to see how the `useState` hook works in practice.

1. **Creating a Counter Component**:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example:
- We import the `useState` hook from React.
- We call `useState(0)` to create a `count` state variable, initialized to `0`, and a `setCount` function to update the `count`.
- When the button is clicked, we call `setCount(count + 1)` to increase the `count` by 1.

2. **Using the Counter Component in App**:

Now, let's use the `Counter` component in our main `App` component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Counter App</h1>
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

When you run this code, you should see a button that, when clicked, increments the counter and updates the displayed count.

#### More Complex State Management

The `useState` hook can also manage more complex state. For example, you can use it to manage an object or an array.

1. **Managing an Object**:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function UserProfile() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: '', age: '' });

  const updateName = (e) => {
    setUser({ ...user, name: e.target.value });
  };

  const updateAge = (e) => {
    setUser({ ...user, age: e.target.value });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Name"
        value={user.name}
        onChange={updateName}
      />
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Age"
        value={user.age}
        onChange={updateAge}
      />
      <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {user.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;
```

In this example:
- We use `useState` to manage an object representing a user profile.
- We update the object properties using the `setUser` function, ensuring we spread the existing properties with `{ ...user }` to retain the other values.

2. **Managing an Array**:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const addTodo = () => {
    const newTodo = { id: todos.length + 1, text: `Todo ${todos.length + 1}` };
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add Todo</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TodoList;
```

In this example:
- We use `useState` to manage an array of todo items.
- We update the array using the `setTodos` function, ensuring we spread the existing array with `[...todos]` to retain the existing items.

#### Conclusion

Today, we've learned about component state and how to manage it using the `useState` hook in functional components. Understanding state management is crucial for building dynamic and interactive React applications.

In the next lesson, we'll explore more advanced hooks and how they can be used to manage side effects and lifecycle events in React components. Stay tuned and happy coding!
