## **What are Strings?**
- Strings in Java are sequences of characters, and they are used to represent and manipulate textual data.
	**String Immutability:**
	- Java strings are immutable, meaning once you create a string, you can’t change it. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.
- A String in Java that is specified as immutable, as the content shared storage in a single **pool** to minimize creating a copy of the same value. String class and all wrapper classes in Java that include Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, and Double are immutable. A user is free to create immutable classes of their own.
```java
String string1 = "abcd"
String string2 = "abcd"
```

### **Declaring and Initializing Strings:**
- **By string literal** : Java String literal is created by using double quotes.
```java
String str = "knowledge"; //inside the pool
```
- **By new keyword** : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”.
```java
String s = new String("Welcome");
//because of the `new` keyword the object is creating outside the pool which each will make seperate objects.
```
#### **proof of that the strings are pointing the same object or different object..**
`==` -->==Comparator check if the ref variable  are pointing to same object.==
`.equals` --> This will check only the values.

`Note:`
	`Objects are stored in the heap memory and the Integers are stored in the Stack memory`.
### **Essential String Methods:**
	length(): Find the length of a string.  
	charAt(): Access individual characters.  
	concat(): Concatenate strings.  
	equals() and equalsIgnoreCase(): Compare strings.  
	indexOf() and lastIndexOf(): Locate substrings.  
	substring(): Extract substrings.  
	trim(): Remove leading and trailing whitespaces.  
	split(): Divide strings using a delimiter.  
	replace(): Replace characters or substrings.  
	toUpperCase() and toLowerCase(): Change case.  
	startsWith() and endsWith(): Check prefixes and suffixes.
## **StringBuilders**
- StringBuilder is a class in Java that allows us to create and manipulate mutable sequences of characters. Unlike the String class, which is immutable, StringBuilder objects can be modified after they are created.

## **String Problem Solving
### [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int len = s.length;
        int start = 0;
        int end = len - 1;
        while (start<end){
            char temp = s[start];
            s[start] = s[end];
            s[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }     
    }
}
```
