## Step by Step Explanation:
1. **Start With a sorted list:** To perform binary search, the input list must be sorted in ascending order.
2. **Define the search range:** Identify the leftmost and rightmost indices of the list that represent the current search range.
3. **Calculate the mid:** Find the middle index of the current range using the formula `mid = (left+right)/2`. 
4. **Compare with the target:** Check if the middle element of the list is equal to, greater than, or less than the target element.
5. **Adjust the search range:** Based on the comparison, update the left and right indices to narrow down the search range. If the middle element is equal to the target, the search is complete. Otherwise, if the middle element is greater than the target then, the target must be in the left half of the current range; otherwise it must be in the right half.
6. **Repeat the process:** Continue the process of dividing the search space in half until the target element is found or until the search range becomes empty.
### Example
- let's take an example array `[2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 45, 56, 72, 91]`.
-  let the target element be `23`.
	- Step 1: **Define the Search Range:** Initially, set `left = 0` and `right = 10` (the first and last indices of the list).
	- Step2: **Calculate the mid:** `mid = (0 + 10) / 2 = 5`.
	- Step3: **Compare the target:** The element at index 5 is 23, which is equal to our target.
	- Step4: **Adject the search range:** We have found the target element.
### Time complexity:
- **BEST CASE:** `O(1)`
- **Total comparison in WORST CASE:** `O(log n)`
