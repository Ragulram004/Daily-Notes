## Platform independent
- It means that byte code can run on all operating systems.
- We need to convert source code to machine code so computer can understand.
- Compiler helps in doing this by turning it into executable code.
- this executable code is a set of instructions for the computer.
- After compiling C/C++ code we get .exe file which is platform dependent.
- In Java we get bytecode, JVM converts this to machine code Java is platform-independent but JVM is platform dependent.
### JDK , JRE , JVM , JIT
![[Pasted image 20240812211132.png]]
#### JDK
- Provide Environment to develop and run the java program.
- It is a package that includes :-
	1. Development tools :- To provide an environment to run your program.
	2. JRE:- To Execute your program.
	3. A compiler :- javac
	4. Archiver :- Jar
	5. Docs generator :- Javadoc
	6. Interpreter/loader
#### JRE
- It is an installation package that provides environment to only run the program.
- It consist of:-
	1. Deployment technology
	2. User interface toolkit
	3. Integration libraries
	4. Base libraries
	5. JVM: Java virtual Machine
#### JVM Execution
Interpreter:
- Line by line execution
- when one method is called many times, it will interpret again and again
#### JIT:
- those methods that are repeated, JIT provides direct machine code so re-interpretation is not required.
- makes execution faster Garbage collector.

#### (How JVM works) Class Loader
Loading:
- reads .class file(file after compilation of .java) and generate binary data an object of this class is created in heap
Linking
- JVM verifies the class file
- allocates memory for class variables & default values
- replace symbolic references from the type with direct references
Initialization
- all static variables are assigned with their values defined in the code and static block
JVM contains the Stack and Heap memory allocations.
