### Sample
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```
- If the class name is Main then the editing file name should also be `Main` with `.java` extension.
- If something else will be an error.
- `javac Main.java` - this command will compile the `Main.java`  file to `Main.class` which contains the bytecode.
- `java Main` - will execute the bytecode.
### Each Keyword Explanation.
#keywords
1. public (in first line):- public is an access modifier which allows to access the class from anywhere.
2. class :- It is a name group of properties and functions
3. Main :- It is just the name of class as same as the name of file.
4. public (in second line) :- It is used to allow the program to use main function from anywhere.
5. static:- It is a keyword which helps the main method to run without using objects.
6. void:- It is a keyword used when we do not want to return anything from a method/function
7. main:-It is the name of method.
8. String [] args :- It is a command line argument of string type array.
9. System:- It is a final class defined in java.lang package.
10. out:- It is a variable of PrintStream type which is public and static member field of the System class.
11. println :- It is a method of PrintStream class, It prints the argumants passed to it and adds a new line. print can aalso be used here but it prints only arguments passed to it. It do not adds a new line.
### Primitive Data Type
#primitivedatatype
- Primitive data types are those data types which is not breakable.
	- ex:
		- String is not primitive data type so we can break this data type.
			- i.e.  "RAM" => 'R' 'A' 'M'

### Float & Double & long
- In float and long we have used f and I, it denotes that the number in the variable is float or long type, if we do not use this java consider float value as double and long value as int.
```java
float f = 242.24f; //f at end
double d = 234.2343242;
long l = 42343243232l; // l at end
```
### Input in JAVA
- We have Scanner class available in java.util package to take input
To use this class we have to
1. Import java.util package in our file.
2. Create object of the scanner class
3. Use that object to take input from the keyboard.
```java
//Syntax:-

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner iinput = new Scanner(System.in);
	}
}
```
- **Scanner :-** It is a class required to take input, it is present in java.util package.
- **input :-** It is an object that we are creating to take input.
- **new :-** It is a keyword used to create an object in java.
- **System.in :-** System is a class and in is a variable that denotes we are taking input from standard input stream (i.e. Keyboard).
### Type Conversion and Casting
- **Implicit Conversion:**
	- when we assign value of smaller datatype to bigger datatype then it is automatically converted to the bigger datatype.
		- e.g. `int i = 100; ===> 100`
		 `float l = i; ===> 100.0` --> converted to float.
	==**byte --> short --> int --> long --> float --> double== ==> hierarchy.**
- **Explicit Conversion:**
	- Assigning the larger data type to a smaller data type makes error. To make that we convert manually is Explicit.
		- e.g. `double d = 100.23232; ===> 100.23232`
			 `int i = (int) d; ===> 100` ---> converted to int.
