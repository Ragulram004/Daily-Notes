#### **Example of Exponential Time Complexity** 
```java
class Fibo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 50; //if n = 8 (i.e smallest num) then this program will work, but 50 it will took too much of time.
        System.out.println(fibo(n));
    } 
    public static int fibo(int n) {
        if (n < 2) {
            return n;
        }
        return fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2);
    }
}
```
## **Time Complexity**
![[basics_of_time_complexity 1.png]]
- **O(1) < O(log(n)) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(2$^n$)**

## **What is Big-oh Notation**
![[Pasted image 20241105213501.png]]
## **Big-Omega Notation**
- Opposite of the **Big-Oh Notation** `Ω(n^3)`
- This means it  will take **n$^3$** time complexity.
- So, this means atleast **n$^3$**, it can also take **n$^4$**, **n$^3$ log n**, **n$^3$ * 2$^n$** etc..., 
	- But, it will never be lesser than **n$^3$**.
- Minimum **n$^3$** time complexity will required.
## **Little-Oh Notation**
- Big-Oh notation was giving the upper bound this little-oh notation also gonna give the upper bound.
- But what is this is not strict upper bound rather it is loose upper bound.

| Big-Oh                                                                | Little-Oh                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| f = O(g)                                                              | f = O(g)                                                                                               |
| it means that the growth of f is no faster that g.<br>          f ≤ g | - it means that it is more like a smaller than g.<br>         f < g<br>- It is strictly slower than g. |
## **Little Omega**
- Big Omega was giving the lower bound, the little omega will also gonna give lower bound. but it will not be tight. So, this is loosely lower bound.

| Big-Omega                                                                             | Little-Omega                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| f = Ω(g)                                                                              | f = Ω(g)                                                   |
| <br>          f  ≥ g<br>- It is giving a lower bound. it can increase more than that. | <br>         f > g<br>- It is strictly greater difference. |
# Space Complexity.
- Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space Complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. (Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm)
- For example, if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space then auxiliary space would be better criteria than space Complexity.
	- Merge sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, 
	- Insertion sort and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space,
