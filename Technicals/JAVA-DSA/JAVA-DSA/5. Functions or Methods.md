- A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
- To reuse code : define the code once and use it many times.
#### Syntax:
 ```java
public class main{
		access_modifier return_type method_name(){
		//code
		return statement;
	}
}

 public class main{
	 static void name_method(){
		 //code
	 }
 }
 // the void represent that the method does not have a return value
```
#### Return Type:
- A return statement causes the program control to transfer back to the caller of the method. A return type may be primitive type like `int` `char` `void(returns nothing)`.
- ##### Important points
	- The type of the data returned by a method must be compatible with the return type specified by the method.
		- e.g. if return type if the some method is Boolean  we cannot return an integer.
	- The variable receiving the value returned by a method must also be compatible with the return type specified for the method.
#### Pass by value:
e.g.1
```java
psvm(){
	name = 'anaswara';
	m1(name);
}
static void m1(a){ //passing the value by reference
	sout(a);
}

//     name----> "anaswara"
//                ^
//                |
//                a
```
e.g.2
```java
psvm(){
	name = 'anaswara';
	m2(name);
	sout(name);
}
static void m2(a){ // not changeing the original object, just creating a new object
	a = "Ram"; 
}
// name------> "anaswara"
//    a------> "Ram"

```
- Note:
	- Primitive data types like `int` `short` `char` `byte` etc... Just pass value.
	- **Object and reference** --> passing value by reference.
- e.g. of passes the value.
	```java
	psvm(){
		a =10;
		b =20;
		swap(a,b); //passes the value
	}
	swap(n1,n2){
		temp = n1; //temp-->10
		n1 = n2; // n1--> 20
		n2 = temp; // n2-->10
	}
```
- e.g. of  pass by reference,
```java
 arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
 nums = arr;
 nums[0] = 99

 arr[99,2,3,4,5]
 //the value of the 0th position in nums will change which also changes value of arr[0]
```
#### Scopes:
- **Function Scope:**
	- Variable declared inside a method/ function scope(means inside method) can't be accessed outside the method.
- **Block Scope:**
	```java
	psvm(){
		int a = 10;
		int b = 20;
			m1(){
				int a = 2; ❌
				a = 100;✅
				int c = 20;
			}
		int c = 10;❌
		c = 200;✅
		a = 21;✅
	}
	```
- **Loop Scope:**
	- Variables declared inside loop are having loop scope.
#### Shadowing:
- Shadowing in java is the practice of using variables in overlapping scopes with the same name where the variable in low-level scope override the variable of high-level scope. 
- e.g. of high-level scope is shadowed by low-level scope
```java
public class Shadowing{
	static int x = 10;
	public static void main(Sting[] args){
		sout(x); // 10
		x = 20; // here high-level scope is shadowed by low-level scope
		sout(x); // 20
	}
}
```
#### Variable Arguments
- variable arguments is used to take a variable number of arguments. A method that takes a variable number of arguments is a `var-args` method.
- Syntax:
```java
static void m1(int...a){
	//method body
}
// here would be array of object of type int[] parameters
```
#### Function Overloading:
- Function overloading happens when tow functions have same name.
e.g. 
```java
m1(int a){
	//code
}
m1(int a, int b){
	//code
}
//This allow having different arguments with same method name.
```
