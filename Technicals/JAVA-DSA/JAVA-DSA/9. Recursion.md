## **What is Recursion**
- Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer programming that allows a function to call itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem.
- In Java, recursion offers a powerful and elegant way to tackle problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.
## **Basics of Recursion**
- To understand recursion, it is crucial to visualize it as a process of breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, each resembling the original problem but on a smaller scale. This is similar to the concept of “divide and conquer,” where a problem is divided into two or more sub-problems, each solved individually, and their solutions are combined to solve the original problem. However, in recursion, there is a critical distinction: the sub-problems must be identical in nature to the original problem, allowing the same solution approach to be applied.
## **The Mechanism of Recursion**

To grasp how recursion works in Java, it’s essential to understand the two main components of a recursive function:

1. **Base Case:** This is the simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly without further recursion. The base case acts as a stopping criterion for the recursive calls, preventing them from continuing indefinitely and leading to a stack overflow error.
2. **Recursive Case:** This is the portion of the function where the recursion occurs. In the recursive case, the function calls itself but with a different set of parameters that bring it closer to the base case. Each recursive call divides the problem into smaller parts, and this division continues until the base case is reached.
## **The Recursive Process**

When a recursive function is called in Java, the current state of the function (including its parameters and local variables) is pushed onto the call stack, a data structure that tracks function calls. The function then calls itself with a new set of parameters, and this new call is added to the top of the call stack. This process continues, with each call occupying a new slot on the stack, until a base case is reached. At the base case, the function returns a value without making any further recursive calls. As the stack unwinds, each function call returns its value to the caller, eventually unwinding all the way back to the original call.
- Example of calculating the sum of all numbers from `1` to `n`.
```java
public class SumCalculator {  
  
	public static int sum(int n) {  
		// Base case: if n is 1, the sum is 1  
		if (n == 1) {  
			return 1;  
		} else {  
			// Recursive case: n + sum of n-1  
			return n + sum(n - 1);  
		}  
	}  

	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		int result = sum(5); // Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 5  
		System.out.println("Sum: " + result); // Output: Sum: 15  
	}  
}
```
## **Base Case and Recursive Case**
### **Base Case**

The base case is the cornerstone of a recursive function, acting as the anchor point that halts the recursion. It represents the simplest scenario that can be solved without further recursion. The base case is critical because it prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely, which would lead to a stack overflow error due to the excessive consumption of stack memory.

Basically, the base case answers the question, “What is the simplest version of this problem?” For example, in a recursive function that computes factorials, the simplest case is the factorial of 0 or 1, both of which are defined as 1. The base case for such a function would return 1 when the input parameter is 0 or 1.

Here’s an illustration using a Java method to compute the factorial of a number:

```java
public class FactorialCalculator {  
  
    public static int factorial(int n) {  
        // Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1  
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {  
            return 1;  
        }  
        // Recursive case is handled outside  
    }  
}
```

In this snippet, `if (n == 0 || n == 1)` represents the base case. If `n` is 0 or 1, the method returns 1, effectively stopping the recursion.

### **Recursive Case**

The recursive case is where the function calls itself, each time with a slightly modified version of the original problem, moving it closer to the base case. This part embodies the essence of recursion, where a complex problem is divided into smaller, more manageable chunks, each resembling the original problem but on a reduced scale.

The recursive case relies on the assumption that by breaking down the problem and applying the same solution strategy to smaller instances, the overall problem can be solved. This requires careful crafting of the recursive call to make sure that each iteration moves closer to the base case, avoiding infinite recursion.

Continuing with the factorial example, let’s complete the function by adding the recursive case:

```java
public class FactorialCalculator {  
  
    public static int factorial(int n) {  
        // Base case  
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {  
            return 1;  
        } else {  
            // Recursive case: n * factorial of (n-1)  
            return n * factorial(n - 1);  
        }  
    }  
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int result = factorial(5); // Calculates the factorial of 5  
        System.out.println("Factorial: " + result); // Output: Factorial: 120  
    }  
}
```

In the recursive case, `return n * factorial(n - 1);` is where the function calls itself with `n-1`. Each call reduces `n` by 1, inching closer to the base case. When the base case is reached (`n` becomes 0 or 1), the recursion stops, and the function begins to return and unwind the stack of recursive calls, eventually calculating the factorial.

#### **Fibonacci**
```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 8;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.println(fibo(i));
        }
    }

    public static int fibo(int n) {
        if (n < 2) {
            return n;
        }
        return fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2);
    }
}

```
## **How to Understand approach recursion problems**
- Identify if you can break down problem into smaller problems.
- Write the recurrence relation if needed.
- Draw the recursive tree.
- About the tree.
	- see the flow of function, how they are getting into the stack.
	- Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.
	- Draw the tree and pointer again and again using pen and paper.
	- Use debugger.
- See how the values and what type of values(int, string etc..) are returned at each step. See where the function call will come out. 
## **Types of recurrence relation**
- Linear Recurrence Relations (inefficient).
- Divide and Conquer Recurrences
#### **Recursive Binary Search**
```java
class recursiveBS{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5,7,8,34,65,69,98,99};
        int target = 34;
        System.out.println(search(arr,target,0,arr.length -1));
    }
    static int search(int[] arr, int target, int s, int e){
        if(s>e){
            return -1;
        }
        
        int mid = s+(e - s)/ 2;
        if(arr[mid] == target){
            return mid;
        }
        if(target > arr[mid]){
            return search(arr,target, mid+1,e);
        }
        return search(arr,target,s,mid-1);
    }
}
```
