#usestate #hook
- useState hook is used for managing states within the functional components.
- States are used to manage and store some data within a component. Whenever a state changes React will automatically re-render the component to display the updated value.

- useState take only one parameter, the value you want your initial state to have initially. It returns an array with two values, that we get using array destructuring.

1. **Initial State:** During the first re-render this will have the value that you passed as the parameter.
2. **set Function:** The set Function will let you update the value of the state to a different value and will trigger a re-render if the value provided in the set function is different.
```jsx
import {useState} from 'react'
function counter(){
	const [num, setNum] = useState(0);  
	return (  
	<>  
		<h1>{num}</h1>  
		<button onClick={() => {  
		setNum(num + 1) // 0 + 1  
		setNum(num + 1) // 0 + 1  
		setNum(num + 1) // 0 + 1  
		}}> +3 </button>  
	</>  
	)
}  

export default counter
```
- Here the count does not increment by 3 because every time the num is 0. 
- It is simply because react uses **_Batching_** behind the scenes to update multiple state variables in only one re-render, it prevents too many re-renders to improve performance.
- To Solve this
```jsx
import {useState} from 'react'
function counter(){
	const [num, setNum] = useState(0);  
	return (  
	<>  
		<h1>{num}</h1>  
		<button onClick={() => {  
		setNum(num => num + 1) // 0 + 1  
		setNum(num => num + 1) // 1 + 1  
		setNum(num => num + 1) // 2 + 1  
		}}> +3 </button>
	</>  
	)
} 
```
## Handling objects or arrays in useState
- It is crucial to avoid directly mutating the values of objects or arrays in React. 
- The reason is that React utilizes object comparison, specifically using [Object.is()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is), to check whether the new value passed is the same or different. 
- When a value within an object is modified directly, React cannot distinguish the change and, as a result, fails to trigger a re-render or update the user interface.
```jsx
obj.name = "aryan" // ❌ do not directly change value of a field in object.  
setObj(obj) // 🚩 this will not update the state/ui.
```
- **_you must always replace the object or arrays with new ones in the state instead of changing their values directly._**
```jsx
// ✅ Here we're passing a new object with a new updated field "name"  
// but everything else will be the same as we're spredding the obj (coping the whole object and replacing the value of "name")  
setObj({...obj,name: "aryan"})
```
