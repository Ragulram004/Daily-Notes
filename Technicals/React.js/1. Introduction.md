## Babel
#babel
- Babel in react operates as **a transpiler, converting the latest JavaScript syntax into a version that can run in all environments**. This is done by converting the latest JavaScript syntax into an older version that is supported by all browsers.
## Why React
- If you've got more complex web apps where you dynamically add and remove elements, this quickly can become cumbersome. So React helps us by making the whole UI state management a non-issue.
- It allows us to focus on our business logic instead of keeping our application from exploding. Additionally, React is maintained by a big community. So therefore, it's highly-efficient and fast.
- Finally, React features a huge ecosystem and an extremely-active community which means that there is a great chance that for a given problem you face, you'll find a solution or an extra package you can add to fix it.
## JSX
#jsx
- JSX **(JavaScript XML)** is a **syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file**. It's based on ES6 and was originally created by Facebook for use with React, but has since been adopted by multiple web frameworks.
## Creating React App
- `npm create react-app appname` - will create a react app along with the node module(which consists all the external packages).
### Vite  
#vite
- Vite is **a free, open-source frontend build tool that aims to speed up the development of modern web projects**. It was created by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, and is used by default by Vue and for React project templates.
- To create `npm create vite@latest` - the `@latest` will download the latest version of Vite.
- Choose the framework to react and select the variant to JavaScript. 
- `cd foldername` and `npm i` - to install third-party libraries and `npm run dev` - to run the server.
