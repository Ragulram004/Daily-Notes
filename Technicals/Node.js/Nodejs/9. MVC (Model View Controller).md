1. **Model:** The Model represents the application’s ==raw data== and logic. It encapsulates data manipulation, storage, and retrieval. By isolating data-related operations, the Model ensures that the application’s data remains consistent and accurate.
2. **View:** The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It presents information in a user-friendly format and is decoupled from the underlying data and logic. This separation allows for flexible and dynamic ==user interfaces==.
3. **Controller:** The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View and processes it by updating the Model or changing the View’s presentation. The Controller orchestrates the flow of data and controls the application’s behavior.
