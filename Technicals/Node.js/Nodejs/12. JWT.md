- JSON Web Token, commonly referred to as JWT, is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

1. **Header**: The header typically consists of two parts — the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

Example:
```json
{  
  "alg": "HS256",  
  "typ": "JWT"  
}
```
2. **Payload**: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about the user or other data. Claims can be of three types: registered, public, and private claims.

Example:
```json
{  
  "sub": "user123",  
  "name": "John Doe",  
  "admin": true  
}
```
3. **Signature**: To create the signature part, you need to take the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header, then sign that with the secret. The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn’t changed along the way.

Example (using HMAC SHA256):
```json
HMACSHA256(  
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),  
  secret  
)
```
