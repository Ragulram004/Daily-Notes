#lexicalenvironment #scopechaining
-  A lexical environment in JavaScript is a data structure that stores the variables and functions that are defined in the current scope and all of the outer scopes. It is also known as the lexical scope or the lexical closure.
```js
function a(){
var b =10;
	c();
	function c(){
		console.log(b);
	}
}

a();
console.log(b);
```
- Lexical environment is created when the execution context is created. 
- Works with the lexical environment of local and lexical environment of parent.
