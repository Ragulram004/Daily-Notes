#hoisting
```js
var  x = 7;
function getName(){
	console.log("Hello World");
}

getname();
console.log(x)
```
- The output of the code is as guessed that is,
	-->Hello Word
	-->7

###### A simple change of the above code 
```js
getname();
console.log(x)
console.log(getname);

var  x = 7;
function getName(){
	console.log("Hello World");
}
```
- The output of the Code will be , 
	-->Hello World
	-->==undefined==
	--> f getname( ){
		console.log("Hello World")
	 }	
- We access getname( ); even before initializing it.
- The method of calling something even before initialization is called Hoisting.
- Before the execution of the code , the variables and functions will be assigned with the memory space and variables default initialized as ==undefined== and the functions will get the copy of the code of that function . That's why output of x is undefined.


```js
getname();
console.log(getname)
console.log(getname2);

//arrow function
var getName = () => {
	console.log("Hello World");
}
// expression function
var getName2 = function(){
	console.log("Hello World!!");
}
```
- The output the above code will be 
	-->==undefined==
	-->==undefined==
- Hoisting does not work in this method as these functions are being declared to a variable which is undefined before initialization.
