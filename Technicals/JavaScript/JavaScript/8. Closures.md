#closures 
- Means the functions binds together with its lexical environment.
- Closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to another function's scope from an inner function , same as lexical environment.

	- The ==a== in console.log does not represent the 7 in it's lexical parent. It only represents the variable in that lexical environment.

### Uses of Closures:
- Module Design Pattern
- Currying
- Functions like once
- memorize
- maintaining state ==in async== world
- setTimeout
- Iterators 
- etc....
# setTimeout + Closures :
#setTimeout #settimeout #asynchronous
- JavaScript's setTimeout function is one of the most useful functions for working with asynchronicity in your code. ItÂ **allows you to run a function after a certain amount of time has passed**.
```js
function x(){
	setTimeout(function(){
		console.log(Hi);
	},3000);
	
	console.log("Hello")
}
x();
```
Output:
	--> Hello //will be printed first
	--> Hi // will be printed after 3000 M sec.
- There will be waiting of the code only for setTimeout block.
- There will no passing of the code outside the block of the setTimeout.
```js
function x(){
	for (var i = 1; i<=5; i++){
		setTimeout(function(){
			console.log(i);
		},i*1000);
	}
		console.log("Hello")
}
x();
```
Output:
	>6
	>6  //after particular time
	>6  //after particular time
	>6  //after particular time
	>6  //after particular time
- This is because at the end of the timer the value of ==--i--== will be 6.
##### same code in let :
```js
function x(){
	for (let i = 1; i<=5; i++){
		setTimeout(function(){
			console.log(i);
		},i*1000);
	}
		console.log("Hello")
}
x();
```
Output :
	>1
	>2  //after particular time
	>3  //after particular time 
	>4  //after particular time
	>5  //after particular time
- But here at single single iteration there will be new new blocks for each ==--i--== in separate blocks.
##### Continuous Output But Using ==Var== :
```js
function x(){
	for (let i = 1; i<=5; i++){
		function close(){
            setTimeout(function(){
    			console.log(i);
    		},i*1000);
        }
        close(i);
	}
		console.log("Hello")
}
x();
```
Output:
	>1
	>2
	>3
	>4
	>5
- Here creating and calling the function inside the for loop will create a new copy of ==--i--== for every iteration.
