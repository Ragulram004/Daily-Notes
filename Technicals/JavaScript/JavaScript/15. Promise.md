- 
- **A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future.**Â Either a resolved value or a rejected value.
#promises #asynchronous #promise
```js
//reference code - do not provide output.
const cart - ["shoes","pants","kurta"];
	createOrder(cart, function(orderID){
		proceedToPayment(orderID);
	})
```
- This is not the better way, of giving the control of the code over another function. This causes the code to risky code.(Inversion Of Control)
- This can be solved by promises.
- In the above code we pass the function to the **createOrder** function. 
```js
//reference code - do not provide output.
const cart - ["shoes","pants","kurta"];

const mypromise = createOrder(cart);

mypromise.then(function(orderID){
		proceedToPayment(orderID);
	});
```
- In this code we **attach** the function to the promise object.
- Once the promise occupied by the creatorder(cart).
- Then the promise.then is proceeded. This will attach to the object of the promise. makes this as async.

```js
const GITHUB_API = "https://api.github.com/users/ragulram004"

const user = fetch(GITHUB_API);
```
-  Until the user(before) the line if the user the user will be undefined.
-  Once the line user executed the user become promise.

#promiseResult
- This simple hold the data.

#promiseState
```js
const GITHUB_API = "https://api.github.com/users/ragulram004"

const user = fetch(GITHUB_API);

console.log(user);
```
Output:
		![[Pasted image 20240127193003.png | 250]]
Do you note that in output in shows **{< pending >}** but when expand that it shows fulfilled..?
	This is because as JavaScript does not wait for code to be executed. At the time before the **fetch** , JS move to next line and executes pending but after a while the fetch will be done so that there **fulfilled** when expanding.

```js
const GITHUB_API = "https://api.github.com/users/ragulram004"

const user = fetch(GITHUB_API);
console.log(user);

user.then(function(data){ // data in here represents the date fetch from the api.
	console.log(data);
});
```
Output:

#statesofpromise 
- There are only three states in the promise
	- _pending_: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. 
	- _fulfilled_: meaning that the operation was completed successfully. 
	- _rejected_: meaning that the operation failed.
- These promise object are immutable( cannot be changed ).

```js
//reference code - do not provide output.

//---->By callback
const cart - ["shoes","pants","kurta"];
	createOrder(cart, function(orderID){
		proceedToPayment(orderID , function (paymentinfo){
			showOrderSummary(paymentinfo , function(){
				updateWalletBalance();
			})
		});
	})
//---->By Promises
const mypromise = createOrder(cart);

mupromise.then(function(orderID){
	return proceedToPayment(orderID);//return makes code readable. 
})//The result of this is moved to next then
.then(function (paymentinfo){
	return showOrdersummary(paymentinfo);
})
.then(function (wallet){
	return updateWalletBalance();
});
________________or___________________________
createOrder(cart)
	.then((orderID) => proceedToPayment(orderID));
	.then((paymentinfo) => showOrdersummary(paymentinfo));
	.then((wallet)=> updateWalletBalance());

```
- This promises make code clear and not worry about the callback function that is not under the control in callback hell.
- This promise makes the code takes under control.
