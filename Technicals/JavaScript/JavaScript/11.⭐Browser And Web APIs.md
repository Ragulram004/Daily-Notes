-  To access Those the browser contains we use the web APIs.
- And these web APIs are not the part of JavaScript. Those web APIs are part of the browser.
- Even **console.log** is not JS. The console object is a **Web API** provided by the Browser to the JavaScript Engine, much like DOM, Fetch, History, Service Workers and Web Storage APIs.
- The Web APIs are not a part of the JavaScript engine, but they are part of the runtime environment provided by the browser. There are a large number of APIs available in modern browsers that allow us to a wide variety of things.

- If I want the power to use the timer that i want to use is JS code that ==window.setTimeout( )==.
- If I want the log in console then ==window.console.log( )==.
- The **window** is the global object. The get into the **GEC**.
- These **APIs** are plugged through window where you can access inside the JS. Global == window . 
# Event loop and callback queue
#eventloop #callbackqueue
- A **Callback queue** is a queue of tasks that are executed after the current task.
- The callback queue stores the callback functions sent from the Web APIs in the order in which they were added. This queue is a data structure that runs [first in, first out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)). The queue uses [the array push method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) to add a new callback function to the end of the queue and [the array shift method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift) to remove the first item in the queue.

#### fetch();
#fetch #microtaskqueue
- As like **Callback queue** there is another queue called **Microtask queue**.
- A **Microtask queue** is a queue of tasks that are executed after the current task. The microtask queue is handled by the JavaScript engine before it moves on to the next task in the callback queue.
- Priority is higher for **Microtask queue** than **Callback queue**.

	- ==What can come inside this microtask queue..?==
		-The call back functions which come through [**Promises](obsidian://open?vault=JavaScript&file=JavaScript%2F15.%20Promises) and Mutation observer** will go inside the **Microtask queue**.
