#### Undefined 
#undefined
- The term undefined in JS is just a keyword that represents that is there is nothing assigned to that variable.
- It acts like a placeholder. Once variable assigned the undefined will gone.
```js
console.log(a); //before assigning the var
var a = 10;
console.log(a);//After assigning
```
output:
	- undefined //for first line
	- 10 //for second line
### Not defined
#notdefined
- Here Not defined refers to that the variable or function or method is not even declared.
### Loosely typed language 
 - JavaScript is a loosely typed language which means that it can assign various types(datatypes) on a single variable.
 - Also called as weakly typed language.
 ```js
 var a;
 console.log(a);
 a = 20;
 console.log(a);
 a = "hello";
 console.log(a);
```
Output:
	- undefined
	- 20
	- hello
