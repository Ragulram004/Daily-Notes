**What is the runtime environment?** 
	-The [JavaScript Runtime Environment](https://medium.com/@gemma.croad/understanding-the-javascript-runtime-environment-4dd8f52f6fca) provides access to built-in libraries and objects that are available to a program so that it can interact with the outside world and make the code work.

# Types of JS Engines

- These JS Engine are created by following the standards that what **ECMAScript programming standards**.
- We can even create our **own JS Engine** using the ECMAScript Standards.
# JS Engine Architecture
#jsenginearchitecture #architecture
	1. JS Engine takes **code as their input**.
	2. The next step is **Parsing**.
	3. Next is **Compilation**.
	4. Next is **Execution**.
#### 2. During the Parsing Phase.
#parsing 
- The **input code** is broke down into **TOKENS**.
```js
let a = 10; // let as one Token 
			// a as another Token
			// = as another Token
			// 10 as another Token
```
- Here it do something called **Syntax Parser**.
- [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net/) This website gives you the tree structure. 
- First, the code is transpiled using babel or any other web pack.
- This form of code is given to the Engine which converts it to AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).
- This AST is then converted to the byte code which is understood by the machine. This is an Intermediate Representation(IR) which is further optimized by the JIT compiler.
- After the optimization, the JS Virtual Machine Executes the code.
#### 3. During Compilation Phase. 
#compilation
##### Interpreter:
#interpreter
- Interpreters are quick. We donâ€™t have to go through that whole compilation step before execution. It just starts translating the first line and then executes it.

##### Compiler: 
#compiler
- The source code is converted into machine code once and then gets executed.

##### Just In Time Compilation. ([JIT compilation](https://medium.com/@aamchora/what-exactly-just-in-time-jit-compilation-is-in-javascript-f7aea482843f))
#justintimecompiler #jit #jitcompiler
- JavaScript use **interpreter along with the compiler** is that **JIT compilation**.

#### 4. During Execution Phase. 
- The **Execution Phase** is only possible with the availability of **Memory heap** and **Call stack**.
##### Memory Heap:
- The memory heap is unordered and can be accessed by references, which are pointers to the locations of the data. The memory heap is managed by a **garbage collector**, then which frees up the memory that is no longer used by the program.
	- This Garbage collector always try to clean the memory heap using mark and sweep algorithm.
