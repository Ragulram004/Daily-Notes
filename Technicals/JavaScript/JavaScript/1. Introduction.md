# How JS Works
#executioncontext 
- Every thing in JS happens inside the ==Execution Context==.
- The ==Execution Context=== consist of two component.

- JavaScript is a ==synchronous single-threaded language==.
	- synchronous means -  the code is executed one after another.
# How execution context created
```js
//Square of a number
var n = 2;
function square(num){
	var ans = num * num;
	return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```
-  By running the code ==global execution context== is created.
##### Memory creation phase of the above code get run.

##### Code execution phase
- When ever any function is called a new execution context is created inside a global execution context. 
- Once the value ==returned== from the new execution context the new execution context will be deleted from the Global execution context.

- After the whole code got run the global execution context will also be deleted ‚ùå. 
# Call Stack 
#callstack
- The JS engine manage the all the context with the Stack method called Call stack.
- The above all Global execution context will be push to the stack.
- when the a function is called the new execution context created will be pushed to the top of the stack. Once the function execution done it will be pop out of the Stack.
- Once the Code executed the stack become empty.
- " Call Stack maintains the ==order of execution== of execution contexts ".
