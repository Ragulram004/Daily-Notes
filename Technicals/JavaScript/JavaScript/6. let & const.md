```js
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
let a = 10;
console.log(a);
var b = 100;
```
 Output: 
	- error : cannot access the var 'a' before initialization.
	- undefined
	- 10  
##### Explanation of the Difference:
- In case of ==var== it is in the global space.
- But in case of ==let== it is in the new space under Script.
	- They are stored in a separate memory space where not related to the global memory space. Also not comes under ==window Object==.
	- And in this space you cannot access the ==let and const== declaration before the value is assigned in them. 
	- ==That's why Hoisting does to work in here==. #notworkinghoisting

### Const:
- This ever more strict than let.
```js 
const a;
a=10;  ❌//Uncaught SyntaxError : Missing initializer in const declaration.

const b = 100;  ✔// should be initialized where it is declared no latter initialization allowed.

const c = 1000;
c=50; ❌//Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to const variable. Cannot change the value latter. Once initialised the value cannot be changeable.

//ReferenceError will occur in the case of temporal dead zone ,and also at accessing the var variable not even declared.

```
#### Temporal Dead Zone
#temporaldeadzone
- The time gab between the ==let== (variable) is hoisted and declaration the value.
```js
1.console.log(a);// Uncaught ReferenceError : Cannot access 'a' before intialization.
2.
3.let a = 10;
4.var b=100;
```
- The temporal dead zone of variable ==a== is upto the 2 line.
