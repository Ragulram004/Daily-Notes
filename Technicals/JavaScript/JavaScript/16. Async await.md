- Actually the JS Engine will not wait for the promise to be done.
- The handlepromise( ) will poped(suspended) out of the **callstack** untill the await is satisfied.
- one the await is satisfied then the JS Engine will push the handlepromise( ) into the **callstack** then the execution takes place.
