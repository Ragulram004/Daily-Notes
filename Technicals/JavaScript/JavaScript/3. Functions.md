# Function invocation and variable environment
```js
var x = 1
a(); //function invocation or function call
b(); //function invocation or function call
console.log(x);

function a(){
	var x = 10;
	console.log(x);
}

function b(){
	var x =100;
	console.log(x);
}
```
- The Output of the above code will be
	--> 10 
	--> 100
	-->1

# shortest JavaScript Program
- The JS will also run even an empty JS file.
- JS will create a GEC and allocate memory even there is no a single line of code.
##### "window"  
#window #jswindow
	- JavaScript have something called "window" Which consist of big Object will lots of function and method created by the JS engine, where you can use those methods anywhere in the program as these are globally declared.

	![[Pasted image 20231223211555.png | 500]]
- When ever a program run ==a global object== is created ==a global execution context== is created and ==this== keyword is created.
	- This ==Global Object== is known as "window" in browser. Create even the file is empty.
	```js
	var x=10;
	function{
		f = 10;
	}
	cosole.log(window.x);
	cosole.log(x);
	console.log(this.x);
	```
- The output of the above code:
	--> 10
	--> 10
	--> 10
- Here ==window.x== == ==x== == ==this.x== . The ==x== will be declared in the global space.
